#### WorkLists, Tries, and Zip ####
-   The ADT for a WorkList explicitly forbids access to the middle elements.  However, the FixedSizeFIFOWorkList has a peek(i) method
    which allows you to do exactly that.  Why is this an acceptable addition to the WorkList ADT in this particular case but not in general?  
    In other words, what about fixed size FIFO worklists makes peek(i) make sense? Why does peek(i) NOT make sense in other worklist implementations?<pre>

-   As we've described it, a `TrieMap` seems like a general-purpose replacement for `HashMap` or `TreeMap`.  Why might we still want to use one
    of these other data structures instead?<pre>

-   One of the applications of Tries is in solving Word Searches.  A "word search" is an n x m rectangle of letters.  The goal is to find all
    of the possible words (horizontal, vertical, diagonal, etc.).  In Boggle, a similar game, any consecutive chain of letters
    are allowed.  Explain (in very high-level pseudo-code) how you might solve this problem with a TrieSet or a TrieMap.  Make sure to detail
    how a similar solution that uses a HashSet/HashMap instead would be different and why using a Trie might make the solution better.<pre>

-   One of the classes in the main package is called Zip.  This class uses your PriorityQueue to do Huffman coding, your FIFOQueue as a buffer,
    your stack to calculate the keyset of a trie (using recursive backtracking), and your SuffixTrie to do LZ77Compression.  Find some text file
    (a free book from https://www.gutenberg.org/ or even the HTML of some website) and use Zip.java to zip it into a zip file.  Then, use a 
    standard zip utility on your machine (Finder on OS X, zip on Linux, WinZip or the like on Windows) to UNZIP your file.  Check that you got back
    the original.  Congratulations!  Your program correctly implements the same compression algorithm you have been using for years!  Discuss in a
    sentence or two how good the compression was and why you think it was good or bad.<pre>

</pre><br>
-   Now that you've played with Zip, we want you to do an **experiment** with Zip.  Notice that there is a constant called `BUFFER_LENGTH` in `Zip.java`.
    Higher values of this constant makes the compression algorithm that Zip uses use more memory and consequently more time.  The "compression ratio"
    of a file is the uncompressed size divided by the compressed size.  Compare time, type of input file, and compression ratio by running
    your code on various inputs.  We would like an in-depth analysis.  You should try at least one "book-like" file, at least one "website-like" file,
    and some other input of your choice.  We expect you to draw meaningful conclusions and possibly have graphs that convince us of your conclusions. 
    Say something about WHY you think you may have gotten the results you did.
    This single question is worth almost as much as the implementation of `ArrayStack`; so, please take it seriously.  If you spend less than 20 minutes
    on this question, there is no conceivable way that you answered this question in the way we were intending.<pre>
